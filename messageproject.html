        <b style="font-size: x-large;">IFSC Code Finder Management System</b>
        <pre style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Description:</pre>An IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) Code Finder Management System is a digital tool designed to assist individuals and businesses in locating and verifying bank branches and their respective IFSC codes. The IFSC code is a unique alphanumeric code assigned to each bank branch in India by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It is used primarily for electronic funds transfer between banks within the country.IFSC Code Finder Management System serves as a valuable resource for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions by providing accurate and reliable information about bank branches and IFSC codes. This facilitates smooth and efficient electronic transactions, including NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer), RTGS (Real-Time Gross Settlement), and IMPS (Immediate Payment Service), within the Indian banking system.

        <b style="font-size: x-large;">Plant Disease Detection</b>
        <pre style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Description:</pre>
        Detecting plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a promising application of machine learning in agriculture. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks, making them an ideal choice for analyzing images of plants to identify diseases.By leveraging CNNs for plant disease detection, farmers can potentially detect diseases earlier, take timely corrective actions, and minimize crop losses, leading to improved crop yields and sustainable agriculture practices.
